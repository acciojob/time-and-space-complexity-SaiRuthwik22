	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity describes how the execution time of an algorithm changes with respect to the input size, using Big O notation to gauge its efficiency. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexities, making them better suited for handling larger datasets and more complex tasks swiftly efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the total amount of memory an algorithm needs relative to the input size, typically expressed in Big O notation like O(n), indicating that memory use scales linearly with input size. Understanding space complexity is crucial for developing efficient algorithms that optimize resource usage.</p>
